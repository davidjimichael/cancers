## Requirements

- define what significance a word has.
- sift the distance from word to word.
- characterize descriptive words surrounding current word.
- allow another dimension for context jumping/looping as in topic is reiterated.
- fuzzymatching of the descriptions in the document to the definition to get grammar particulate usage
