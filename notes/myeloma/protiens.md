# Myeloma Protiens

## Protien Structure

- primary: amino acid structure
- secondary: initial folding (based?: {charge|molecule interior angles}) alpha helices, beta strands
- tertiary: folding secondaries into domains
- quaternary (biological units): functional assemblies of chains (subunits)

## Types of M Proteins

> identified by combinations of light and heavy chains
> electrolytic shocks show tall and narrow peak in region of antibodies corresponding to M protiens 
> important due to resistance to phagocytosis by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (immuno resistant deconstruction needed)

- heavy
  - IgG
  - IgA
  - IgD
